Known issue for IE:

Need to download the registry key from https://heliumhq.com/docs/internet_explorer. (Error code: Unable to get IE)

Need to change IE security settings - Select "Internet options" from the Tools menu (or the gear icon in the toolbar in later versions). Open the Security tab. At the bottom of the dialog for each of the zones ("Internet", "Local intranet", "Trusted sites" and "Restricted sites"), you should see a check box labeled "Enable Protected Mode". Set the value of the check box to the same value, either checked or unchecked (unchecked is better), for each zone. (Error code: Protected Mode settings)

Need to set IE Zoom to 100% - Select "Internet options" from the Tools menu (or the gear icon in the toolbar in later versions). Set Zoom to 100%. (Error code: Browser zoom level)
